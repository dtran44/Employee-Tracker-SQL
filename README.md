# Employee-Tracker-SQL

## Description
The goal of this project was to create an interface for an employer to easily view and interact with department, roles and employees information stored in a database.

I learnt how to:
- Use SQL to create a schema and seed data for the department, role and employee table
- Use Javascript and inquirer to build a command line application that accepts user input
- To use UUID npm package to create a unique ID to allow the deletion of the note
